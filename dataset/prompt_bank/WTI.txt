The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil index represents the daily price of US light crude oil over an 11-year period. The data is aligned to business days, with weekends and holidays forward-filled using the last valid observation during training. Forecasting is performed only for actual trading days. Crude oil prices are known to exhibit strong non-stationarity, volatility, and sensitivity to external events such as geopolitical crises and macroeconomic shifts. Seasonality is also present due to increased demand in winter for heating oil and in summer for gasoline. The forecasting task aims to model short-term temporal patterns and local trends using a sliding window approach. This helps capture high-frequency dynamics while remaining robust to longer-term cycles and shocks. Please predict the next H steps given the preceding T steps.
