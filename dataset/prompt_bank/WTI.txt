The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil index represents the daily price of US light crude oil over a 10-year period. The dataset is aligned to business days, with non-trading days (e.g., weekends and holidays) forward-filled during training using the last observed value. However, predictions are only required for actual trading days. Forecasting is performed using a sliding window approach to capture short-term temporal patterns and local dynamics.
