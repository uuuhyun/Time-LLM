This dataset contains 11 years of daily WTI crude oil prices aligned to business days. Weekends and holidays are forward-filled using the last observed value during training, and forecasting is performed only for actual trading days. Crude oil prices are influenced by seasonal demand fluctuations, including increased heating oil usage in winter and higher gasoline consumption in summer. A sliding window approach is used to capture short-term temporal patterns and local trends.
